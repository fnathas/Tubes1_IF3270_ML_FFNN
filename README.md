# Tubes 1 - Machine Learning Kelompok 52

## Feed-Forward Neural Network from Scratch
A fully implemented Feed-Forward Neural Network built from scratch using NumPy, featuring customizable activation functions, loss functions, and weight initializers. Designed for Tubes 1 Machine Learning, this implementation allows experimentation with network architecture, hyperparameters, and training strategies.

## Requirements

- uv

## Installation

bash
uv sync

## Usage

Open the notebook.ipynb file in the src directory.

use .venv as the kernel.
